/**
 * The flyweight class contains a portion of the state of a
 * tree. These fields store values that are unique for each
 * particular tree. For instance, you won't find here the tree
 * coordinates. But the texture and colors shared between many
 * trees are here. Since this data is usually BIG, you'd waste a
 * lot of memory by keeping it in each tree object. Instead, we
 * can extract texture, color and other repeating data into a
 * separate object which lots of individual tree objects can
 * reference.
